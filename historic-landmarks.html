                <p>The Red Deer Hospital was built in 1904 as a memorial to three local men who died in the Boer (South African) War while serving with Lord Strathcona's Horse regiment. Numerous donations were gathered to aid in the construction including a large gift from Lord Strathcona himself.</p>

                <p>Construction commenced on the hospital in the spring of 1903 but the Board of Directors ran out of money and the Town Council had to provide assistance. The new building was completed in spring 1904 at a cost of $12,000.</p>

                <p>The new hospital had 11 private wards and two public wards, able to accommodate twenty-three patients. There was a reception room, a spacious operating room with surgery and a large kitchen. The attic could also be used for dormitories.</p>

            <h2>Buffalo Hotel and Club Café Redevelopment</h2>

            <p>In late 2022, The City purchased the sites at 5021 and 5023 Ross 50th Street downtown, with the intent to redevelop the area. Included among the two parcels of land are the Buffalo Hotel and Club Café.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, these properties were in poor state of disrepair and evaluations found it would be cost-prohibitive to restore the buildings or repurpose the space. To maximize use of these and neighbouring properties, the buildings will be demolished, and properties primed for redevelopment.</p>

            <p>Council approved budget for the purchase, demolition and activation of the site. Once the buildings have been demolished, the site can be combined with existing adjacent City-owned land at 5022 49th Street to offer a prime downtown space for redevelopment.</p>
